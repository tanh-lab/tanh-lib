## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `dsp::granular`: reverse playback from the markers alone — End before Start
  makes Start the entry and End the exit, so the Sample head runs backwards
  (re-entering at Loop) and Loop-mode grains scan and play backwards.
  `SampleRegion` keeps ascending bounds plus `m_reverse` and mirrors only the
  read position (`physical()`), so the loop floor, crossfade pool and
  region-shrink logic are unchanged. Grain reads wrap below zero.

- `dsp::utils::MorphWindow`: a bank of eight grain windows (Rectangle,
  Trapezoid, Half cosine, Triangle, Hann, Gaussian, Narrow, Impulse) morphed
  by a continuous shape value — integers land exactly on a shape, fractions
  blend the neighbours — and skewed by a tilt in [-1, 1] that moves the peak
  by warping time around it. One shared instance, 512-point tables, peak 1,
  silent end points. `GrainProcessorImpl` reads two new parameters,
  `GrainWindowShape` and `GrainWindowTilt` (subclasses must serve them); a
  grain keeps the window it was born with.

- `dsp::granular::GrainProcessorImpl`: engine modes — `EngineMode::GranularPosition`
  (grains sprayed around a parked `Position` with `Spray` / `Tilt`),
  `EngineMode::GranularLoop` (previous scan behaviour) and `EngineMode::Sample`
  (one continuous varispeed head, no grains). New parameters `EngineModeParam`,
  `Position`, `Spray`, `Tilt` extend the subclass `Parameter` enum; subclasses
  must serve them from `get_parameter_*`. Mode switches on a sounding voice fade
  through zero (`k_mode_change_fade_duration`).
- Sample mode in `MonoToStereo` puts half the mono sum in each channel, the
  level a centred grain has under the linear pan law, so a mode switch no
  longer steps the level by 6 dB.
- Sample mode crossfades every head discontinuity — loop wrap, pitch-bank
  switch and retrigger — with a small pool of outgoing heads, so a second
  discontinuity inside a fade never hard-cuts.

### Changed

- `dsp::granular::GrainEngine` render loop: bank pointers and pan gains are
  resolved once per block per grain, one channel-mode kernel is chosen per
  block, and the window comes from the new `dsp::utils::MorphWindow`.
  Roughly half the CPU at a full pool; `test/dsp/benchmark_Granular.cpp`
  measures it. Idle voices no longer scan the pool and report to the
  visualiser every block.
- Position mode: a Spray window past either sample edge clips to the edge
  instead of wrapping to the other end — what the waveform band shows.

- `dsp::granular` split into components: `GrainProcessorImpl` is now the
  per-voice facade (parameter snapshot `VoiceParams`, master ADSR, mode fade)
  over a pre-allocated `GrainEngine` (grain pool + scheduler, told where to
  start grains by a `HeadPolicy`: `LoopScanHead` / `PositionSprayHead`) and a
  `SamplePlayer` (the Sample-mode head). `SampleReader`, `SampleRegion` and
  `channel_mixer` are the shared, header-only helpers. Constants and enums
  moved to `GranularTypes.h` (still reachable through `GrainProcessor.h`).
  The subclass contract (`Parameter` enum, the three `get_parameter_*` hooks)
  is unchanged. Behaviour differences: a Sustain change now retunes the decay
  slope at once (the per-setter path left the rate stale until another
  envelope parameter moved); lingering grains are always reported finished on
  reset / silence; `prepare()` starts the voice from silence.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

First release with a changelog: earlier releases (v0.1.0, v0.2.0) are described only by their tag messages (`git tag -n1 v0.1.0 v0.2.0`).

### Added

- `Logger`: configurable platform-sink identity. `LoggerConfig::m_platform_tag`
  (Android logcat tag, journald `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER`), `m_platform_subsystem` and
  `m_platform_category` (Apple `os_log`) name what the platform sink files records
  under, so an embedder (anira) shows up under its own name in `adb logcat -s`,
  Console.app and `log stream`. Defaults `"thl"`, `"thl"`, `"logger"` keep the
  previous output; an empty string selects the default. Set them before the first
  record: a later `set_config()` applies to records dispatched after it returns, and
  on Apple platforms creates a new `os_log_t` (which the system never releases).
- `Logger`: per-record flags. `LogRecord::m_flags` travels unchanged from the
  emitting site to the sinks (the console, file and platform sinks ignore it; the
  callback sink sees it). New overloads take the flags right after the level:
  `log_with_source(level, flags, source, group, message)`,
  `logf(level, flags, group, fmt, ...)`, `rt::logf`/`rt::log(level, flags, ...)` and
  `rt::Queue::logf`/`vlogf`/`log(level, flags, ...)`; the existing signatures pass
  0. Reserved bits: `k_flag_realtime` (1, set by `rt::Queue::drain()` on every
  record it dispatches) and `k_flag_contract_violation` (2, only ever set by the
  caller). The real-time producers stay allocation- and lock-free (one more
  `uint32_t` in the fixed-size record).
- `Logger`: `LogRecord::m_dropped_before`. A `rt::Queue::drain()` pass takes the
  queue's drop counter before it pops and puts the count on the first record it
  dispatches; every other record carries 0, so summing the field over all records
  received counts every drop exactly once. `format_plain()` appends
  `[N real-time log message(s) dropped before this record]` and `format_logfmt()`
  a `dropped_before=N` field to a record that carries a count.

- CMake: `TANH_LOG_COMPILED_MAX_LEVEL` (`AUTO`, or `1`..`4`) chooses the most verbose log
  level compiled into the call sites. `AUTO`, the default, keeps the historical rule
  (Error only in Release builds, every level otherwise); an embedder that wants its runtime
  level to be the only filter in a shipped build sets `4` as a plain variable before the
  fetch.

### Changed

- `Logger`: the synthetic drop warning of `rt::Queue::drain()` (level Warning, source
  `rt`, group `thl.logger`) is only dispatched when a pass has no record to carry the
  count. Its message is now `real-time log queue overflowed` with the count in
  `m_dropped_before` (and in the rendered suffix), instead of
  `N real-time log message(s) dropped (queue full)` after every pass with drops.
