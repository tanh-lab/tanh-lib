TODOs

- [ ] Fix the update from json method to be real-time safe and lock-free??? (Really)
- [ ] Delete unecessary convinience methods in RCU (set, get, has, replace, ...?)
- [ ] Add an in gestrue parameter...
- [ ] Think about the buffered strings implementation in the path resolution. Is there no more elegant way?
- [ ] Atomics not needed in the parameter class, as RCU already provides thread-safety!
