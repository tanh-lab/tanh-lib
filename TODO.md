TODOs

- [ ] Fix the update from json method to be real-time safe and lock-free??? (Really)
- [ ] Find a solution for atomic only lock-free setting (We don't need this yet!)
- [ ] Delete unecessary convinience methods in RCU (set, get, has, replace, ...?)
- [ ] Fix the weird string buffers in the state class for path resolution (or think about it more)
