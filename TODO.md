TODOs

- [ ] Fix the update from json method and the param to json method.
- [ ] Add an in_gesture option to the state
- [ ] How to register threads without beeing on them? For rcu and buffer registration! So that we don't have a single real-time violation on audio threads.
- [ ] Think about the buffered strings implementation in the path resolution. Is there no more elegant way?
